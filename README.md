# Subtitle Substitute
A "subtitle injector" (to be) extension.

## Purpose of the project
### Legend
Entertainment service provider: A company that provides a platform that lets people watch TV-Shows/Movies, etc.
Consumer: The person who is using the service that is provided by the entertainment service provider.

### Information
There are consumers who do not speak or in the process of learning the language of the country they live. Some entertainment providers use region based subtitle sets. In this case, consumer either has to know the original language of the content or the language of the region consumer lives.

### Problem
In the event of having a "foreign" entertainment planned, consumer who does not speak or in the process of learning the region language is sometimes left with no way to understand the events that occur in the "foreign" entertainment source.

### Proposed solution
Create a safe (work in progress) yet badly practiced piece of software as an extension and inject 3rd party subtitles through the extension so that the consumer can use whatever language as the subtitle.

This is a tool that needs to cease to exist to have a better consumer experience.
